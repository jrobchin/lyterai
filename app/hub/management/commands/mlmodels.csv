Real Estate Room Classifier,Image Classifier,This model is used to classify an image of a room as one of seven classes.,The real estate room classifier was built on top of the pre-trained <a href='http://www.image-net.org/'' target=blank>ImageNet</a> weights VGG16 convolutional blocks with the addition of a fully connected layer built for this task.<br><br>The model has 27826503 parameters and is composed of an input layer that takes 224px by 224px colour images which have been preprocessed to zero centered by mean pixel for each colour channel five convolutional/max pooling blocks and 3 fully connected layers with dropout. The first two convolutional blocks each contain two 2D convolutional layers and 2D max pooling layer. The last three convolutional blocks each contain three 2D convolutional layers and 2D max pooling layer. Each convolution block's input shape is half in each dimension from the one before it. The output of the last convolutional block is flattened and fed into the fully-connected layer: composed of two dense layers with relu activations and a last output layer with 7 nodes with sigmoid activationsone for each class. <br><br> On a test set of 200 images unseen by the model during trainingan accuracy of 90.10% was achieved. In practicethis accuracy and number of classes is usually sufficient as properties in Canada often have 20 photos. This model <b><em>can</em></b> be trusted to always label an image of each class correctly for an image set like this. <br><br> Weaknesses of the model include a missing 'dining room' and 'stair set' classas images of those classes are often found in virtual tours but labeled data of these classes is currently limited. The model has only been tested on Western style real estateit is possible that rooms far from the Western style could have less optimal results.,real-estate-image-classifier,,,90.10416,models/title-card-rerc.jpg
